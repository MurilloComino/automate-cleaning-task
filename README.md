# Automate Cleaning Task

The project is intended to automate the task of cleaning up Android Studio projects without the need to open Android Studio or run by command line. It only works on Windows Operating System.

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:MurilloComino/automate-cleaning-task.git
```

### Prerequisites

You must have the gradlew files in the root directory of each project.

## How it works
* Paste the cleanProject.bat file into the root directory where the projects you want to clean are located.
```
My projects
  ├───cleanProjects.bat
  ├───Project1
  ├───Project2
  └───Project3    
```

* Then open the file. It will already clean up all projects.
